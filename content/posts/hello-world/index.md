I've had a number of blogs over the years. I'm going to try this again. People
_claim_ to be interested in what I have to say, so I will share some of it, if
only to prove them wrong.

## Technology

I write code for a living. Well, that's part of it. I write code, I design systems,
I mentor young engineers, and I teach. Sometimes I work on stuff I think is neat,
and I might share some of it. Some of my current interests:

* [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com)
* [Go](https://go.dev)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* On-Premise virtualization, or: how I learned to stop worrying and learn to love `libvirt`
* High-performance messaging

Notice how "crypto" and "AI" aren't on this list? [I will fucking piledrive you.](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/)

## Food

I love food. I love making it and eating it. I will probably share some recipes from
time to time.

## Woodworking

I enjoy spending time in my woodshop (my non-climate-controlled woodshop, so I currently
get about three comfortable months a year). I will probably post stuff about that too.
